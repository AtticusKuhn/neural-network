# Neural Network
The goal of this project is for me to implement a neural network
in Python by myself with no dependencies (not even numpy).
I am doing this to try and learn how neural networks function.
# Sources
I am intenionally not looking at any other implementations or resources, and
just looking at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk by
3blue1brown. I want to see how far I can get by myself.
# How to run
to run, do
```bash
python3 ./main.py
```
this will train the neural net, and then run it.
